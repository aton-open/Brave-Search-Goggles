# Introduction and Reason For this project
In the past finding information on the internet was just fine. Google won over the hearts and minds of millions because their Algorithm was as close to perfect as one can get. That Algorithm improved over time. The internet was an amazing new way to find information on almost any subject, connect with new people, and even make money. Things as you and many others know have been changing, large corporations learned the mysterious algorithm which google used to sort results. A new industry of Search Engine Optmization (SEO) has boomed fast and become large. This ruined the experience and magic of the internet.

SEO is simple in principal but is complex in practice. The algorithms change constnatly and tricks whcih worked two years ago no longer work. As companies and website owners got more skilled at getting higher in the results, the internet got worst. Many websites are not written with giving information in mind, they are written with SEO in mind. We have all had the experience with searching for an answer to a simple problem and getting facefucked with 95 paragraphs on unrelated information. For example a website will claim to give you answers on why the power button isn't working but then goes on a tangent with 'What is a power button', 'The History of the Power button', 'What does the iPhone Power Button Does', then finally your solution. 

In order to get around this problem with low quality websites, people simply append 'Reddit' to get the answers (RIP Yahoo answers). You should not have to do this, the internet should be more...better. That is what we look to do, not only with Antobyte Curated Web but with all of the future projects I will start.

The internet used to have curators, AOL or Yahoo in the 90s was a good example of this. Once google came out, cutating the experience and being the gatekeeper gave way to indexing the entire web. I argue that many people want a curator, we want the low quality garbage and now AI written websites out of our view, not even gettning a chance to show up. I would like to be trusted by you to be the Curator of your internet.

## When To Use Antobyte Curated Web
If you are looking for a certain website and only that website, don't use this Goggle. Use this Goggle for viewing a limted and more factual internet. If you are lookign for accurate info, trusted institutions are lsited here. BobScience.com or jackknowseverything.net are not available (sorry bob and jack). 

## Future Projects
I am currently learning how to make open source applicaitons for Android. I want to make useful apps which I can't find the right solution for, I know there is a need in thr market for these apps. But all of my apps will enable people to own and control their data.
